                        Let's dive a bit deeper into the fascinating world of refrigerators. So, imagine a life without the trusty fridge â€“ no cold drinks on a hot day, no fresh veggies for your salads, and certainly no ice cream waiting to comfort you after a rough day. The refrigerator is a culinary cornerstone, preserving the freshness and nutritional value of our food by maintaining a consistently low temperature.<br>
                        <br>Now, let's break down the components that make this kitchen marvel tick. At the heart of the fridge is the compressor, akin to the engine of a car. It compresses the refrigerant gas, elevating its pressure and temperature. This hot, pressurized gas then flows through the condenser coils located on the back or bottom of the fridge. The coils dissipate the heat, transforming the gas into a high-pressure liquid.<br>
                        <br>As this liquid refrigerant journeys into the interior, it encounters the evaporator coils. Here's where the magic happens. The refrigerant absorbs the heat from inside the fridge, turning back into a low-pressure gas. This process chills the interior, keeping your perishables crisp and your beverages refreshingly cool.<br>
                       <br>Now, let's step into the time machine and explore the historical roots of this indispensable appliance. While Oliver Evans conceptualized the first practical refrigerator in 1805, it wasn't until the early 20th century that these devices became commonplace in households. Innovations like Freon, developed in the 1920s, revolutionized refrigeration technology, making appliances more efficient and safer.<br>
                        <br>In essence, the refrigerator isn't just a cooling box; it's a testament to human ingenuity, continually evolving to meet our ever-changing needs. So, the next time you grab that chilled water or reach for leftovers, remember, it's not just a fridge â€“ it's a silent hero, preserving the freshness of your culinary adventures.<br></span>

                <h1>MICROWAVE</h1>
                </section>
            <div class="products-item">
                <div class="product-wrapper">

                    <p class="right-paragraph" id="product-paragraph">
                        <br>Microwaves are kitchen superheroes, zapping our leftovers into warm delights, but their journey began in the mid-20th century. The microwave oven was an accidental invention by Percy Spencer in 1945. Working on radar technology during World War II, he noticed a chocolate bar in his pocket had melted due to microwaves emitted by the magnetron. This led to the birth of the first microwave oven, aptly named the "Radarange."<br>
                        <br>Now, let's dive into the science. Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation, just like radio waves and visible light. The magic happens when these microwaves enter the oven and are absorbed by water, fats, and sugars in the food. Unlike conventional ovens that heat from the outside, microwaves penetrate the food, causing the molecules to vibrate and generate heat throughout. This makes for quicker and more efficient cooking, perfect for our fast-paced lives.</br>
                        <br>The heart of a microwave is the magnetron, a device that produces the microwaves. When you set the cooking time, the magnetron goes into action, emitting microwaves that bounce around the oven and get absorbed by the food. The turntable ensures even heating by rotating the dish, preventing cold spots. The convenience of microwaves revolutionized cooking, making it a staple in households worldwide.</br>
                    </br>However, it's essential to choose microwave-safe containers, as some materials can't handle the intense heat generated. Microwaving is a balance a quick, efficient method that's changed the way we approach cooking. So, the next time you warm up that bowl of soup, remember the accidental genius behind the kitchen marvel we call the microwave!</span>

            <p class="right-paragraph" id="product-paragraph">
                A washing machine (laundry machine, clothes washer, washer, or simply wash) is a home appliance used to wash laundry"<br>
                <br>The term is mostly applied to machines that use water as opposed to dry cleaning (which uses alternative cleaning fluids and is performed by specialist businesses) or ultrasonic cleaners.<br>
                <br>The user adds laundry detergent, which is sold in liquid, powder, or dehydrated sheet form, to the wash water.<br>
      <br>Laundering by hand involves soaking, beating, scrubbing, and rinsing dirty textiles. Before indoor plumbing, it was necessary to carry all the water used for washing, boiling, and rinsing the laundry from a pump, well, or spring. Water for the laundry would be hand carried, heated on a fire for washing, then poured into a tub. This meant the amount of warm, soapy water was limited; it would be reused, first to wash the least soiled clothing, then to wash progressively dirtier laundry. Removal of soap and water from the clothing after washing was a separate process. First, soap would be rinsed out with clear water. After rinsing, the soaking wet clothing would be formed into a roll and twisted by hand to extract water. The entire process often occupied an entire day of work, plus drying and ironing.<br>
                <br>
            <br> Overall, washing machines simplify the task of laundry while providing efficient and effective cleaning for various types of clothing and fabrics.</span>

    <h1>AIR CONDITIONING UNIT</h1>

            <br>Air-conditioning units work by extracting heat from the indoor air, cooling it through a refrigeration cycle, and then releasing the cooled air back into the space. They also help control humidity levels, providing a more comfortable and controlled environment. There are various types of air-conditioning units, including window units, split systems, central air systems, and portable units, each designed for different applications and preferences.</br>
            <br>Air conditioning, often abbreviated as A/C (US) or air con (UK),[1] is the process of removing heat from an enclosed space to achieve a more comfortable interior environment (sometimes referred to as 'comfort cooling') and in some cases also strictly controlling the humidity of internal air. Air conditioning can be achieved using a mechanical 'air conditioner' or alternatively a variety of other methods, including passive cooling and ventilative cooling. Air conditioning is a member of a family of systems and techniques that provide heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). Heat pumps are similar in many ways to air conditioners, but use a reversing valve to allow them both to heat and to cool an enclosed space.</br>
            <br>Air conditioners, which typically use vapor-compression refrigeration, range in size from small units used within vehicles or single rooms to massive units that can cool large buildings. Air source heat pumps, which can be used for heating as well as cooling, are becoming increasingly common in cooler climates.</br>
            <br>According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), as of 2018, 1.6 billion air conditioning units were installed, which accounted for an estimated 20% of electricity usage in buildings globally with the number expected to grow to 5.6 billion by 2050. The United Nations called for the technology to be made more sustainable to mitigate climate change and for the use of alternatives, like passive cooling, evaporative cooling, selective shading, windcatchers, and better thermal insulation. CFC and HCFC refrigerants such as R-12 and R-22, respectively, used within air conditioners have caused damage to the ozone layer, and HFC refrigerants such as R-410a and R-404a, which were designed to replace CFCs and HCFCs, are instead exacerbating climate change. Both issues happen due to the venting of refrigerant to the atmosphere, such as during repairs. HFO refrigerants, used in some if not most new equipment, solve both issues with an ozone damage potential (ODP) of zero and a much lower global warming potential (GWP) in the single or double digits vs. the three or four digits of HFCs.</span>

            <br>A ceiling fan is a mechanical device suspended from the ceiling of a room. It typically consists of rotating blades that circulate air to create a cooling effect. Ceiling fans are commonly used to improve ventilation and enhance comfort in residential and commercial spaces.</br>
            <br>A ceiling fan is a fan mounted on the ceiling of a room or space, usually electrically powered, that uses hub-mounted rotating blades to circulate air. They cool people effectively by increasing air speed. Fans do not reduce air temperature or relative humidity, unlike air-conditioning equipment but create a cooling effect by helping to evaporate sweat and increase heat exchange via convection. Fans add a small amount of heat to the room mainly due to waste heat from the motor, and partially due to friction. Fans use significantly less power than air conditioning as cooling air is thermodynamically expensive. In the winter, fans move warmer air, which naturally rises, back down to occupants. This can affect both thermostat readings and occupants' comfort, thereby improving the energy efficiency of climate control. Many ceiling fan units also double as light fixtures, eliminating the need for separate overhead lights in a room.</br>

            <br>A dishwasher is a kitchen appliance designed for cleaning and washing dishes, utensils, and cookware. It typically uses water jets, detergent, and sometimes heat to remove food particles and stains from dishes, providing an automated and efficient way to clean kitchen items.</br>
            <br>A dishwasher is a machine that is used to clean dishware, cookware, and cutlery automatically. Unlike manual dishwashing, which relies on physical scrubbing to remove soiling, the mechanical dishwasher cleans by spraying hot water, typically between 45 and 75 Â°C (110 and 170 Â°F), at the dishes, with lower temperatures of water used for delicate items.

<br>A mix of water and dishwasher detergent is pumped to one or more rotating sprayers, cleaning the dishes with the cleaning mixture. The mixture is recirculated to save water and energy. Often there is a pre-rinse, which may or may not include detergent, and the water is then drained. This is followed by the main wash with fresh water and detergent. Once the wash is finished, the water is drained; more hot water enters the tub by means of an electromechanical solenoid valve, and the rinse cycle(s) begin. After the rinse process finishes, the water is drained again and the dishes are dried using one of several drying methods. Typically a rinse-aid, a chemical to reduce the surface tension of the water, is used to reduce water spots from hard water or other reasons.</br>

        <br> In addition to domestic units, industrial dishwashers are available for use in commercial establishments such as hotels and restaurants, where many dishes must be cleaned. Washing is conducted with temperatures of 65â€“71 Â°C (149â€“160 Â°F) and sanitation is achieved by either the use of a booster heater that will provide an 82 Â°C (180 Â°F) "final rinse" temperature or through the use of a chemical sanitizer.</span>

            <br>A stand fan, also known as a pedestal fan, is a type of electric fan mounted on an adjustable stand. It typically consists of a set of blades encased in a protective grill, a motor, and a height-adjustable stand. Stand fans are designed to provide cooling by circulating air in a room and are often adjustable to direct airflow at different heights and angles for comfort.</br>
            <br>Fans have been around for as long as you can imagine. The fan that you likely know today is the one where you plug into a wall outlet and switch on to dissipate heat. But itâ€™s the predecessor of the handheld fan, which is believed to have originated back in 3000 B.C. 
</br>
            <br>Archaeological findings show that the early Greeks used handheld fans not only to cool themselves but also for certain ceremonies. Eventually, those fans became the folding type which was a status symbol in Europe. During the 17th century, fans were only used for the noble and the royalty.</br>
            <br>The next incarnation of fans would be the electric fan which has become a staple appliance, especially in tropical countries. Continue reading to know more about the different types of fans available in the market today.</br>
<br>As you may deduce from its name, a tower fan is a tall and narrow fan. Its space-saving design means it is ideal to use in small rooms. It also comes with added features like built-in ionizers that help in purifying the air. </br>
<br>On average, a tower fan stands between 30 and 40 inches. Its base, meanwhile, takes up around one square foot of space. Because of its compact and space-saving design, you can place a tower fan in corners and narrow spaces where it wonâ€™t get in the way of people moving around.</br>
<br>Tower fans come in bladed and bladeless designs. Most models have motorized blades. But bladeless tower fans have hollow tubes conducting airflow at high velocities. This type of tower fan can yield benefits like quiet operation and safer design, which makes it ideal for families with small children.</br>
<br>Tower fans can rotate from side to side or oscillate, allowing to circulate airflow over a wider area. Tower fans can oscillate with an arc of 90 to 95 degrees, although you can find models that are capable of oscillating a full 360 degrees.</span>

            <br> A lamp is a device that produces light, typically by using electricity to illuminate a bulb or other light source. Lamps come in various designs, such as table lamps, floor lamps, or desk lamps, and serve both functional and decorative purposes in providing lighting for indoor spaces.</br>
            <br>An electric light, lamp, or light bulb is an electrical component that produces light. It is the most common form of artificial lighting. Lamps usually have a base made of ceramic, metal, glass, or plastic, which secures the lamp in the socket of a light fixture, which is often called a "lamp" as well. The electrical connection to the socket may be made with a screw-thread base, two metal pins, two metal caps or a bayonet mount.</br>
            <br>The three main categories of electric lights are incandescent lamps, which produce light by a filament heated white-hot by electric current, gas-discharge lamps, which produce light by means of an electric arc through a gas, such as fluorescent lamps, and LED lamps, which produce light by a flow of electrons across a band gap in a semiconductor.</br>
            <br>The energy efficiency of electric lighting has increased radically since the first demonstration of arc lamps and the incandescent light bulb of the 19th century. </br>
<br>Modern electric light sources come in a profusion of types and sizes adapted to many applications. Most modern electric lighting is powered by centrally generated electric power, but lighting may also be powered by mobile or standby electric generators or battery systems. Battery-powered light is often reserved for when and where stationary lights fail, often in the form of flashlights or electric lanterns, as well as in vehicles.

            <br>A blender is a kitchen appliance used for mixing, pureeing, or emulsifying food and liquids. It typically consists of a motorized base, a container with blades, and controls for adjusting speed. Blenders are commonly used for tasks like making smoothies, soups, sauces, and other blended or mixed recipes.</br>
            <br>A blender (sometimes called a mixer or liquidiser in British English) is a kitchen and laboratory appliance used to mix, crush, purÃ©e or emulsify food and other substances. </br>
            <br>A stationary blender consists of a blender container with a rotating metal or plastic blade at the bottom, powered by an electric motor that is in the base. </br>
            
<br>The operation of an immersion blender requires that the user hold down a switch for as long as the blades operate, which can be tiresome for the user. Handheld blenders are ideal for small and specific tasks but do not have as many uses as a countertop blender.</br>
<br>The hand-held immersion blender, stick blender, hand blender or wand blender has no container of its own, but instead has a mixing head with rotating blades that can be immersed in a container. Immersion blenders are convenient for homogenizing volumes that are too large to fit in the bowl of a stationary blender or as in the case of soups, are too hot to be safely poured into the bowl.</br>
<br>Some powerful models can also crush ice and other frozen foods. The newer immersion blender configuration has a motor on top connected by a shaft to a rotating blade at the bottom, which can be used with any container.

            <br>A coffee maker is a kitchen appliance designed for brewing coffee. It typically involves the infusion of coffee grounds with hot water to produce a brewed coffee beverage. Coffee makers come in various types, including drip coffee makers, espresso machines, French presses, and pod-based systems, catering to different preferences and brewing methods.
        </br>
            <br>A coffeemaker, coffee maker or coffee machine is a cooking appliance used to brew coffee. While there are many different types of coffeemakers, the two most common brewing principles use gravity or pressure to move hot water through coffee grounds. In the most common devices, coffee grounds are placed into a paper or metal filter inside a funnel, which is set over a glass or ceramic coffee pot, a cooking pot in the kettle family. Cold water is poured into a separate chamber, which is then boiled and directed into the funnel and allowed to drip through the grounds under gravity. This is also called automatic drip-brew. </br>

            <br>A food processor is a kitchen appliance used to facilitate repetitive tasks in the preparation of food. Today, the term almost always refers to an electric-motor-driven appliance, although there are some manual devices also referred to as "food processors". Food processors are similar to blenders in many forms. A food processor typically requires little to no liquid during use, and even its finely chopped products retain some texture. A blender, however, requires a set amount of liquid in order for the blade to properly blend the food, and its output is also more liquidy. Food processors are used to blend, chop, dice, and slice, allowing for quicker meal preparation.

</br>
            <br>Food processors normally have multiple functions, depending on the placement and type of attachment or blade. Some of the more challenging tasks include kneading stiff doughs, chopping raw carrots, and shredding a hard cheese, which may require a more powerful motor. Accessories such as blender and juicer attachments may allow a food processor to perform the duties of other appliances.</br>
            <br>The base of the unit houses a motor which turns a vertical shaft. A bowl, usually made of transparent plastic, fits around the shaft. Cutting blades can be attached to the shaft; these fit so as to operate near the bottom of the bowl. Shredding or slicing disks can be attached instead; these spin near the top of the bowl. A lid with a "feed tube" is then fitted onto the bowl.
</br>
            <br>The feed tube allows ingredients to be added while chopping or slicing. It also serves as a chute through which items are introduced to shredding or slicing disks. A "pusher" is provided, sized to slide through the feed tube, protecting the user's fingers.
Almost all modern food processors have safety devices which prevent the motor from operating if the bowl is not properly secured to the base or if the lid is not properly secured to the bowl.

            <br>A hair dryer, hairdryer or blow dryer is an electromechanical device that blows ambient or hot air over damp hair to speed the evaporation of water to dry the hair. Blow dryers enable better control over the shape and style of hair, by accelerating and controlling the formation of temporary hydrogen bonds within each strand. These bonds are powerful (allowing stronger hair shaping than the sulfur bonds formed by permanent waving products) but are temporary and extremely vulnerable to humidity. They disappear with a single washing of the hair. Hairstyles using blow dryers usually have volume and discipline, which can be further improved with styling products, hairbrushes, and combs during drying to add tension, hold and lift.

</br>
            <br>Blow dryers were invented in the late 19th century. The first, stationary, model was created by Alexandre F. Godefroy in his salon in France. The handheld, household hair dryer first appeared in 1920. Blow dryers are used in beauty salons by professional stylists and in the household by consumers. Most hair dryers consist of electric heating coils and a fan that blows the air (usually powered by a universal motor). The heating element in most dryers is a bare, coiled nichrome wire that is wrapped around mica insulators. Nichrome is used due to its high resistivity, and low tendency to corrode when heated.
</br>
            <br>A survey of stores in 2007 showed that most hair dryers had ceramic heating elements (like ceramic heaters) because of their "instant heat" capability. This means that it takes less time for the dryers to heat up and for the hair to dry. Many of these dryers have "normal mode" buttons that turn off the heater and blow room-temperature air while the button is pressed. This function helps to maintain the hairstyle by setting it. The colder air reduces frizz and can help to promote shine in the hair.
</br>
            <br>Many feature "ionic" operation, to reduce the build-up of static electricity in the hair,[4] though the efficacy of ionic technology is of some debate. Manufacturers claim this makes the hair "smoother". Hair dryers are available with attachments, such as diffusers, airflow concentrators, and comb nozzles.

            <br>A mixer (also called a hand mixer or stand mixer depending on the type) is a kitchen device that uses a gear-driven mechanism to rotate a set of "beaters" in a bowl containing the food or liquids to be prepared by mixing them. Mixers help automate the repetitive tasks of stirring, whisking or beating. When the beaters are replaced by a dough hook, a mixer may also be used to knead.
</br>
            <br>A mixer may be a handheld mechanism known as an eggbeater, a handheld motorized beater, or a drill mixer. Stand mixers vary in size from small counter top models for home use to large capacity commercial machines. Stand mixers create the mixing action by either rotating the mixing device vertically (planetary mixers), or by rotating the mixing container (spiral mixers)
</br>
            <br>A hand mixer is a hand-held mixing device. A handle is mounted over an enclosure containing the motor. The motor drives the beaters which are immersed in the food to perform the mixing action. The motor must be lightweight as it is supported by the user during use. The user may use any suitable kitchen container to hold the ingredients while mixing.

            <br>A rice cooker or rice steamer is an automated kitchen appliance designed to boil or steam rice. It consists of a heat source, a cooking bowl, and a thermostat. The thermostat measures the temperature of the cooking bowl and controls the heat. Complex, high-tech rice cookers may have more sensors and other components, and may be multipurpose.</br>
            <br>The term rice cooker formerly applied to non-automated dedicated rice-cooking utensils, which have an ancient history (a ceramic rice steamer dated to 1250 BC is on display in the British Museum). It now applies mostly to automated cookers. Electric rice cookers were developed in Japan, where they are known as suihanki (Japanese: ç‚Šé£¯å™¨, literally, "boil-rice-device". A basic rice cooker has a main body (pot), an inner cooking container which holds the rice, an electric heating element, and a thermostat.
</br>
            <br>The bowl is filled with rice and water and heated at full power; the water reaches and stays at boiling point (100 Â°C, 212 Â°F). When the water has all been absorbed, the temperature can rise above boiling point, which trips the thermostat. Some cookers switch to low-power "warming" mode, keeping the rice at a safe temperature of approximately 65 Â°C (150 Â°F); simpler models switch off; the rice has entered the resting phase.</br>
            <br>More advanced cookers may use fuzzy logic for more detailed temperature control, induction rather than resistive heating, a steaming tray for other foods, and even the ability to rinse the rice.</span>

Most bread machines have different cycles for different kinds of doughâ€”including white bread, whole grain, European-style (sometimes labelled "French"), and dough-only (for pizza dough and shaped loaves to be baked in a conventional oven). Many also have a timer to allow the bread machine to function without operator input, and some high-end models allow the user to program a custom cycle.</br>
            <br>Some breadmakers sold in the 1990s had vertical pans, some horizontal. Today, the vast majority available retail make horizontal loaves. For that reason, they produce a smaller, shorter loaf than their predecessors. It is more difficult to mix a long, horizontal loaf because the ends are distant from the mixer-paddle and gravity does not assist the distribution of the dough. Some machines attempt a better kneading by using two paddles, one at each end. The vertical loaf machine may require a higher powered motor, because the entire mass of the dough-ball is on the paddle as it kneads the dough against the nearby sides of the loaf-pan.

            <br>A juicer, also known as a juice extractor, is a tool used to extract juice from fruits, herbs, leafy greens and other types of vegetables in a process called juicing. It crushes, grinds, and/or squeezes the juice out of the pulp. A juicer clarifies the juice through a screening mesh to remove the pulp unlike a blender where the output contains both the liquids and solids of the processed fruit(s) or vegetable(s).</br>
            <br>Some types of juicers can also function as a food processor. Most of the twin gear and horizontal masticating juicers have attachments for crushing herbs and spices, extruding pasta, noodles or bread sticks, making baby food and nut butter, grinding coffee, making nut milk, etc.
</br>
            <br>Squeezers are used for squeezing juice from citrus such as grapefruits, lemons, limes, and oranges. Juice is extracted by pressing or grinding a halved citrus along a juicer's ridged conical center and discarding the rind. Some reamers are stationary and require a user to press and turn the fruit, while others are electrical, automatically turning the ridged center when fruit is pressed upon.
</br>
            <br>A centrifugal juicer cuts up the fruit or vegetable with a flat cutting blade. It then spins the produce at a high speed to separate the juice from the pulp. A masticating juicer known as cold press juicer or slow juicer uses a single auger to compact and crush produce into smaller sections before squeezing out its juice along a static screen while the pulp is expelled through a separate outlet.

            <br>Grilling is a form of cooking that involves heat applied to the surface of food, commonly from above, below or from the side. Grilling usually involves a significant amount of direct, radiant heat, and tends to be used for cooking meat and vegetables quickly. Food to be grilled is cooked on a grill (an open wire grid such as a gridiron with a heat source above or below), using a cast iron/frying pan, or a grill pan (similar to a frying pan, but with raised ridges to mimic the wires of an open grill).
</br>
            <br>Heat transfer to the food when using a grill is primarily through thermal radiation. Heat transfer when using a grill pan or griddle is by direct conduction. In the United States, when the heat source for grilling comes from above, grilling is called broiling. In this case, the pan that holds the food is called a broiler pan, and heat transfer is through thermal radiation.
</br>
            <br>Direct heat grilling can expose food to temperatures often in excess of 260 Â°C (500 Â°F). Grilled meat acquires a distinctive roast aroma and flavor from a chemical process called the Maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction only occurs when foods reach temperatures in excess of 155 Â°C (310 Â°F).
</br>
            <br>Studies have shown that cooking beef, pork, poultry, and fish at high temperatures can lead to the formation of heterocyclic amines, benzopyrenes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are carcinogens. Marination may reduce the formation of these compounds. Grilling is often presented as a healthy alternative to cooking with oils, although the fat and juices lost by grilling can contribute to drier food.</span>

            <br>An espresso machine brews coffee by forcing pressurized water near boiling point through a "puck" of ground coffee and a filter in order to produce a thick, concentrated coffee called espresso. Multiple machine designs have been created to produce espresso. Several machines share some common elements, such as a grouphead and a portafilter. An espresso machine may also have a steam wand which is used to steam and froth liquids (such as milk) for coffee drinks such as cappuccino and caffÃ¨ latte.</br>
            <br>Espresso machines may be steam-driven, piston-driven, pump-driven, or air-pump-driven. Machines may also be manual or automatic. Numerous machine designs have been created to produce espresso. Several machines share some common elements.
</br>
            <br>A grouphead (or group head) is the receiver for the removable portafilter (or group handle). A typical consumer espresso machine normally has only one grouphead, while popular professional machines, such as those used at commercial coffee shops, can contain anywhere from one to seven. During the process of extracting a shot of espresso, hot water is forced through the grouphead under pressure. The grouphead contains many holes (the shower) that attempt to distribute the pressurised water evenly over the surface of the grinds in the portafilter basket and thereby achieve an even cross sectional flow.
<br>
<br>A portafilter (or group handle) attaches to the grouphead of semi-automatic and piston-driven espresso machines, and carries a tamped puck of coffee grounds within its basket. It is usually made of brass for better heat retention, and is attached by a plastic or wooden handle. The portafilter forms a seal with the espresso machine's gasket, and directs high-pressure hot water through the coffee puck. After-market retailers also sell bottomless portafilters that minimize the espresso's contact with any metal. A bottomless portafilter is one tool baristas use to analyze the quality of the coffee grind and the evenness of the extraction and allows for a visual check of "channeling" or the condition in which water is able to pierce a hole in the espresso puck during the brew process leading to poor extraction. Often, baristas use knockboxes to store their spent espresso grounds after they have pulled a shot.

            <br>A mixer (also called a hand mixer or stand mixer depending on the type) is a kitchen device that uses a gear-driven mechanism to rotate a set of "beaters" in a bowl containing the food or liquids to be prepared by mixing them.
</br>
            <br>Mixers help automate the repetitive tasks of stirring, whisking or beating. When the beaters are replaced by a dough hook, a mixer may also be used to knead.
</br>
            <br>A mixer may be a handheld mechanism known as an eggbeater, a handheld motorized beater, or a drill mixer. Stand mixers vary in size from small counter top models for home use to large capacity commercial machines. Stand mixers create the mixing action by either rotating the mixing device vertically (planetary mixers), or by rotating the mixing container (spiral mixers). 
</br>
            <br>A hand mixer is a hand-held mixing device. A handle is mounted over an enclosure containing the motor. The motor drives the beaters which are immersed in the food to perform the mixing action. The motor must be lightweight as it is supported by the user during use. The user may use any suitable kitchen container to hold the ingredients while mixing. The first handheld electric mixer patent was submitted by Sunbeam Corporation in 1953 and granted in 1961.

            <br>A can opener (North American and Australian English) or tin opener (British English) is a mechanical device used to open metal tin cans. Although preservation of food using tin cans had been practiced since at least 1772 in the Netherlands, the first can openers were not patented until 1855 in England and 1858 in the United States. These early openers were basically variations of a knife, though the 1855 design continues to be produced.
</br>
            <br>The can opener consisting of the now familiar sharp rotating cutting wheel that runs round the can's rim to cut open the lid was invented in 1870, but was considered very difficult to operate for the ordinary consumer. A more successful design came out in 1925 when a second, serrated wheel was added to hold the cutting wheel on the rim of the can. This easy-to-use design has become one of the most popular can opener models.
</br>
            <br>Around the time of World War II, several can openers were developed for military use, such as the American P-38 and P-51. These featured a robust and compact design with a pull cutting blade hinged to a corrugated handle with a pivot. Electric can openers were introduced in the late 1950s and met with success. The development of new can opener types continues with a recent redesign of a side-cutting model.

            <br>An ice cream mixer, often referred to as an ice cream maker or churn, is a kitchen appliance used to create homemade ice cream. It's a device designed to churn and freeze a mixture of ingredients to produce a creamy frozen dessert. There are several types of ice cream mixers available:
Manual Ice Cream Makers: These typically consist of a bowl that needs to be pre-frozen, a churn or paddle, and a hand crank or mechanism to churn the mixture manually. Users add their ice cream base into the frozen bowl and then churn it until it reaches the desired consistency.
Electric Ice Cream Makers: These are powered by electricity and usually have a freezing unit built-in. They include an inner bowl that needs to be frozen in advance, a mixing paddle, and an electric motor that churns the mixture automatically. They're generally more convenient than manual models as they don't require hand-cranking.
</br>
            <br>Compressor Ice Cream Makers: Unlike the previous types that require pre-freezing the bowl or other parts, compressor ice cream makers have a built-in freezer. They can continuously churn and freeze multiple batches of ice cream without the need for pre-freezing the bowl, allowing for faster and consecutive batches. Ice cream mixers allow users to control the ingredients, enabling them to create various flavors, cater to dietary restrictions, and experiment with different recipes. The basic process involves mixing a combination of cream, milk, sugar, flavorings, and sometimes eggs, and then churning the mixture until it thickens and freezes.
</br>
            <br>Preparing the ice cream base by combining ingredients like cream, milk, sugar, and flavorings.
Chilling the mixture in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight. Assembling the ice cream maker and turning it on to start churning.

            <br>A water dispenser is a device used to dispense water, typically providing either hot, cold, or room temperature water. It is commonly found in households, offices, schools, and public places.
</br>
            <br>When using a water dispenser, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning, changing the water bottles (if applicable), and maintaining the unit to ensure clean and safe drinking water. Cooling and Heating Mechanisms: Dispensers have refrigeration or heating systems to cool or heat the water as desired.
</br>
            <br>Filtration Systems: Point-of-Use dispensers often include water filtration systems to purify the water before dispensing. Design and Size: Water dispensers come in various sizes, from compact countertop models to freestanding units.
</br>
<br>A water dispenser, known as water cooler (if used for cooling only), is a machine that dispenses and often also cools or heats up water with a refrigeration unit. It is commonly located near the restroom due to closer access to plumbing. A drain line is also provided from the water cooler into the sewer system.

Water dispensers come in a variety of form factors, ranging from wall-mounted to bottle filler water dispenser combination units, to bi-level units and other formats. They are generally broken up into two categories: point-of-use (POU) water dispensers and bottled water dispensers. POU water dispensers are connected to a water supply, while bottled water dispensers require delivery (or self-pick-up) of water in large bottles from vendors. Bottled water dispensers can be top-mounted or bottom-loaded, depending on the design of the model.

Bottled water dispensers typically use 11- or 22-liter (5- or 10-gallon) dispensers commonly found on top of the unit. Pressure coolers are a subcategory of water dispensers encompassing drinking water fountains and direct-piping water dispensers. Water cooler may also refer to a primitive device for keeping water cool.</br>
<br>The wall-mounted type is connected to the building's water supply for a continuous supply of water and electricity to run a refrigeration unit to cool the incoming water, and to the building's waste disposal system to dispose of unused water. Wall-mounted water coolers are frequently used in commercial buildings like hospitals, schools, businesses, and other facilities where a facility manager is present to monitor its installation and maintenance. In the standard wall-mounted cooler, also commonly referred to as a water fountain or drinking fountain, a small tank in the machine holds chilled water so the user does not have to wait for chilled water. Water is delivered by turning or pressing a button on a spring-loaded valve located on the top of the unit, that turns off the water when released. Some devices also offer a large button on the front or side. Newer machines may not have a button at all; instead, a sensor that detects when someone is near and activates the water. Water is delivered in a stream that arches up, allowing the user to drink directly from the top of the stream of water. These devices usually dispense water directly from the municipal water supply, without treatment or filtering. Wall mount water coolers come in a wide variety of styles, from recessed models to splash resistant, contoured basins protruding out from the wall, traditional rounded square edge designs, bottle filler and water cooler combination units, bi-level designs, with other features and options. These are sometimes installed to meet local, state or federal codes.</br>
<br>Hot Water Safety Features: Dispensers that provide hot water often have safety features to prevent accidental burns, such as child locks or indicators. Ease of Maintenance: Regular cleaning and maintenance are essential for hygiene and optimal functioning.

            <br>Popcorn makers, whether they're traditional stovetop pots, microwave popcorn bowls, or electric popcorn machines.
Choose the right popcorn: Use high-quality popcorn kernels. There are various types available, such as yellow or white kernels, mushroom-shaped, butterfly-shaped, etc. Each type may produce slightly different popcorn.
</br>
            <br>Preheat the popcorn maker: Depending on the type of popcorn maker you're using, preheat it accordingly. Electric popcorn machines usually have an on/off switch and might require a few minutes to warm up. For stovetop pots or microwave bowls, you might not need to preheat. Add oil or butter (optional): Some popcorn makers, especially stovetop pots, may require a small amount of oil or butter to help heat the kernels evenly and add flavor. Electric popcorn machines might have a built-in butter melting feature.
</br>
            <br>Add popcorn kernels: Pour the desired amount of popcorn kernels into the popcorn maker. The quantity will depend on the size and capacity of your popcorn maker. Close/cover the popcorn maker: Ensure the lid is securely closed to prevent the popcorn from popping out. Start the popping process: Turn on the popcorn maker or place it in the microwave according to the instructions. For stovetop pots, you'll need to keep the pot over heat and shake it occasionally to prevent burning.
</br>
            <br>Always follow the specific instructions that come with your popcorn maker for the best results and safety precautions. Cleaning instructions may also vary based on the type of popcorn maker you're using, so refer to the manual for proper maintenance.
</br>
<br>There are many different types of popcorn makers available on the market, but most of them are self-operating and only need the addition of oil, kernels, and any extra ingredients that might be used in the process to be added to the popcorn maker. Before you get popping youâ€™ll have to figure out which kind you want to use and then follow the directions below. Keep reading to discover what you need to buy and how to use the different models so that you can pop your perfect bowl of popcorn. Most popcorn makers use either hot air or hot oil to pop your kernels. As you might have guessed, the air-popped popcorn uses hot air to make the popcorn kernels pop. This method of cooking isnâ€™t as messy and it also creates popcorn that is lower in fat than oil-popped popcorn. The downside is that it can have more of a bland and slightly cardboardy taste and texture. Oil-popped popcorn is a method where the hot oil makes your delicious popcorn kernels pop. You can use the oil-popping method on the stovetop, with an electric popcorn maker, or with an old-fashioned, professional-style popcorn maker. The downside to oil-popped popcorn is that it is higher in fat, which makes it more of a mess to clean up afterward. But the flavor and crispy texture are so delicious that I think itâ€™s worth using the oil method if you prefer that style. To make your perfectly popped bowl of popcorn you are going to want to have a few crucial items on hand.</span

            <br>A kettle, sometimes called a tea kettle or teakettle, is a device specialized for boiling water, commonly with a lid, spout, and handle. There are two main types: the stovetop kettle, which uses heat from a hob, and the electric kettle, which is a small kitchen appliance with an internal heating element.</br>
            <br>In countries with 200â€“240 V mains electricity, electric kettles are commonly used to boil water without the necessity of a stove top. The heating element is typically fully enclosed, with a power rating of 2â€“3 kW. This means that the current draw for an electric kettle is up to 13 A, which is a sizeable proportion of the current available for many homes: the main fuse of most homes varies between 20 and 100 amps. In countries with 120 V mains electricity, twice as much current is drawn for the same power.</br>
            <br>In modern designs, once the water has reached boiling point, the kettle automatically deactivates, preventing the water from boiling away and damaging the heating element. Electric kettles were introduced as an alternative to stovetop kettles in the latter part of the 19th century. In 1893 the Crompton and Co. firm in the United Kingdom started featuring electric kettles in their catalogue. However, these first electric kettles were quite primitive as the heating element couldn't be immersed in the water. Instead, a separate compartment underneath the water storage area in the kettle was used to house the electric heating element. The design was inefficient even relative to the conventional stove-top kettles of the time.</span>

            <br>Television (TV) is a telecommunication medium for transmitting moving images and sound. The term can refer to a television set, or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment, news, and sports.</br>
            <br>Television became available in crude experimental forms in the 1920s, but only after several years of further development was the new technology marketed to consumers. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white television broadcasting became popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the U.S. and most other developed countries.</br>
            <br>The availability of various types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes, LaserDiscs, high-capacity hard disk drives, CDs, DVDs, flash drives, high-definition HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded materialâ€”such as moviesâ€”at home on their own time schedule. For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now also occurs on the cloud (such as the video-on-demand service by Netflix). In the late 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in different formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, iPlayer and Hulu.</span>
